</code></pre>

<p>With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937 , but again failed.
On 21 February the League of Nations Non-Intervention Committee ban on foreign national "volunteers" went into effect. The large city of Málaga was taken on 8 February . On 7 March , the German Condor Legion equipped with Heinkel He 51 biplanes arrived in Spain; on 26 April the Legion Bombed the town of Guernica, killing hundreds. Two days later , Franco's army overran the town.
After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In July , they made a move to recapture Segovia, forcing Franco to pull troops away from the Madrid front to halt their advance. Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on 3 June , and in early July , despite the fall of Bilbao in June , the government launched a strong counter-offensive in the Madrid area, which the Nationalists repulsed with difficulty. The clash was called "Battle of Brunete" after a town in the province of Madrid.
Franco invaded Aragón in August and then took the city of Santander. With the surrender of the Republican army in the Basque territory and after two months of bitter fighting in Asturias (Gijón finally fell in late October ) Franco had effectively won in the north. At the end of November , with Franco's troops closing in on Valencia, the government had to move again, this time to Barcelona.
